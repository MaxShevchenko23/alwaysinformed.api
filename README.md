#Always Informed

This is my second project i'm proud of. It is back-end of the news service. The front-end part you can find in my profile, its named "alwaysinformed"

Service works like this:
1) Author writes an article and sends it on moderation
2) Admin accepts/declines the written article
3) Finally reader sees the article on the main page

As you noticed, this project assumes 3 roles: Reader, Author and Admin. Every role has, besides its own functionality, abilities of the Reader.
(e.g. admin can leave a comment and author can observe the main page and like articles)

Reader can:
- load latest articles
- load a chosen article
- filter articles
- like article
- leave a comment
- make an author profile

Author can:
- send written article to moderation
- observe its own articles
- edit written article
- everything reader can (besides making author's profile)

Admin can:
- load all articles pending approval
-
